## Overview

Adversaries may attempt to take advantage of a weakness in an Internet-facing computer or program using software, data, or commands in order to cause unintended or unanticipated behavior. In the context of the Collection tactic, this exploitation is focused on gathering information or data from the target system.

Exploitation of public-facing applications can involve targeting websites, web-based databases, APIs, and other services that are accessible from the internet. Common targets include content management systems, customer portals, e-commerce platforms, web applications, and public APIs.

For data collection purposes, adversaries often target databases through SQL injection attacks, allowing them to extract sensitive information directly from backend databases. They may also exploit vulnerabilities in web applications to access cached data, session information, or user credentials stored in memory or temporary files.

Successful exploitation for collection purposes often goes beyond just gaining initial access - it focuses on accessing, querying, or exfiltrating specific data of interest to the attacker. This can include customer information, financial data, intellectual property, or authentication credentials that provide access to additional resources.

Detection of exploitation for collection purposes can be challenging as the activities may blend in with normal application usage patterns. Monitoring for unusual data access patterns, suspicious queries, or unexpected data transfers can help identify such activities.
