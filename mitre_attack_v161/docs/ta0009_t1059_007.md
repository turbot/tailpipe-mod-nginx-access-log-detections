## Overview

Adversaries may abuse JavaScript for execution. JavaScript is a high-level, dynamic, and interpreted programming language that is widely used within web browsers and other applications to provide dynamic content. JavaScript can be leveraged by adversaries to perform a variety of malicious activities.

JavaScript allows execution of arbitrary code within a web browser or other application that supports it, such as Node.js. It can be embedded in webpages, included from external files, or injected through cross-site scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities. 

Attackers frequently use JavaScript for client-side attacks, including browser exploitation, fingerprinting, cookie theft, credential harvesting, keylogging, and various web-based attacks. JavaScript can also be used for server-side attacks when applications like Node.js are targeted.

JavaScript-based attacks commonly target web applications and can execute in the context of the user's browser, potentially leading to session hijacking, DOM manipulation, or stealing of sensitive information. Many JavaScript-based attacks leverage obfuscation techniques to evade detection by security tools.

Common JavaScript attack vectors include cross-site scripting (XSS), HTML injection, event handler abuse, and JavaScript URI schemes. These can be delivered through various means including compromised websites, phishing emails, or malicious advertisements.
