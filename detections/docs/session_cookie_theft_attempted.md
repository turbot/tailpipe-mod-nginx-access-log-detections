## Overview

Detect potential attempts to steal or manipulate web session cookies. Session cookies are critical authentication components that maintain user state across HTTP requests. If an attacker can steal or manipulate these cookies, they can potentially hijack user sessions, gaining unauthorized access to accounts without needing to know the user's credentials. This type of attack bypasses many traditional security controls, including multi-factor authentication.
