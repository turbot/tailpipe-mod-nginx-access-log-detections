Detect IPs exceeding request rate limits, which may indicate DoS attempts or aggressive scanning. Rate limiting is a critical security control that protects web applications from various threats, including denial of service attacks, brute force login attempts, and aggressive web scraping. Unusual request volumes from a single source often indicate automated tools rather than legitimate user behavior.
