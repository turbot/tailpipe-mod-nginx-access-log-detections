## Overview

Detect when personally identifiable information (PII) was exposed in URLs to check for potential data privacy violations, regulatory non-compliance, or sensitive information leakage risks. PII includes any data that could potentially identify a specific individual, such as social security numbers, credit card numbers, email addresses, passwords, and phone numbers. When this sensitive information appears in URLs, it creates significant privacy and security risks, as URLs can be logged in multiple locations, cached, or appear in browser history.
