## Overview

Detect requests from known malicious or suspicious user agents in access logs. The User-Agent HTTP header identifies the client application, operating system, and software version making the request. Certain user agents are associated with vulnerability scanners, penetration testing tools, or malicious automated scripts rather than legitimate browsers or applications.
