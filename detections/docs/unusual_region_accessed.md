## Overview

Detect access attempts from unusual or unauthorized cloud regions based on IP geolocation. Many organizations have geographical restrictions for accessing sensitive applications or data due to compliance requirements, threat intelligence about high-risk regions, or business operational boundaries. Accesses from unexpected geographic locations could indicate compromised credentials, VPN/proxy usage to bypass restrictions, or targeted attacks from specific regions.
