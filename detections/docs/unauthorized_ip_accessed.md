## Overview

Detect when access from unauthorized IP ranges or geographic locations was detected in logs to check for potential network-level access control bypasses, geofencing violations, or unauthorized resource access risks. Restricting access based on IP addresses is a common security control to limit exposure of sensitive applications and data to trusted networks only. Accesses from unauthorized IP addresses may indicate security policy violations, compromise attempts, or misconfigured network security controls.
