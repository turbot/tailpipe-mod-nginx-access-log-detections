## Overview

Detect patterns of automated bot activity based on request patterns and user agents. While some bots are beneficial (e.g., search engine crawlers), many bots conduct malicious activities such as content scraping, credential stuffing, vulnerability scanning, or distributed denial of service attacks. Identifying and managing bot traffic is crucial for protecting web applications from abuse and ensuring resources remain available for legitimate users.
