## Overview

Detect when early signs of DDoS attack were detected in logs to check for potential coordinated attacks, traffic anomalies, or resource exhaustion attempts targeting the web server. Distributed Denial of Service (DDoS) attacks aim to overwhelm web servers with traffic from multiple sources, making services unavailable to legitimate users. Early detection of these attacks is crucial for implementing timely mitigation measures and minimizing service disruption.
