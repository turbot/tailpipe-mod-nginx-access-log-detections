## Overview

Detect unusual patterns that might indicate zero-day exploitation attempts. Zero-day vulnerabilities are previously unknown security flaws that don't yet have patches or mitigations. Attackers exploiting these vulnerabilities often use unusual or innovative techniques that differ from known attack patterns, making them particularly dangerous and difficult to detect using traditional signature-based approaches.
