## Overview

Detect when endpoint error rate was increased in logs to check for specific application failures, problematic API endpoints, or targeted attack patterns affecting particular resources. While overall error rates provide a broad view of application health, endpoint-specific error rates help pinpoint exactly which components or functionality are experiencing issues. This granular visibility enables more efficient troubleshooting and targeted remediation efforts.
