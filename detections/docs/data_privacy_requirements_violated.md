## Overview

Detect when data privacy requirements were violated in logs to check for potential regulatory non-compliance, inadequate data protection controls, or sensitive information handling risks. As data privacy regulations like GDPR, CCPA, HIPAA, and others become more stringent, organizations must ensure that their web applications properly protect sensitive personal information. Violations of these requirements can lead to significant regulatory penalties, loss of customer trust, and data breaches.
