## Overview

Detect when restricted resources or administrative areas were accessed in logs to check for potential unauthorized access, privilege escalation, or inadequate access control risks. Administrative interfaces, management consoles, and other restricted areas often provide elevated privileges and access to sensitive functionality that should be limited to authorized personnel only. Unauthorized access to these resources could lead to system compromise, data breaches, or service disruption.
