## Overview

Detect when Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) was attempted in access logs. XSS is a web security vulnerability that allows attackers to inject malicious client-side scripts into web pages viewed by other users. These attacks exploit the trust a user has for a particular site by inserting code that executes in the victim's browser, potentially stealing cookies, session tokens, or sensitive information.
